## About the Project  

This project combines the power of machine learning with music discovery to create a **two-part system**:  

1. **Genre Classification Model**: Utilizes ensemble learning methods (Random Forest and XGBoost) to classify music tracks into five distinct genresâ€”pop, rock, jazz, country, and classicalâ€”with 84% accuracy.  
2. **Song Recommendation System**: Employs GPT-3.5 via LangChain to dynamically generate SQL queries, delivering personalized playlists based on user moods or activities.  

The system uses a rich dataset of over a million tracks sourced from the [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset?resource=download), incorporating features like tempo, danceability, and energy for accurate predictions and recommendations.

## Key Features  

- **Interactive Mood-Based Recommendations**: Users input their mood or desired vibe to receive a curated playlist tailored to their preferences.  
- **Robust Machine Learning**: An ensemble classification model ensures accurate genre predictions across diverse datasets.  
- **Dynamic SQL Queries**: GPT-3.5 Turbo is leveraged for generating SQL queries, improving the personalization of recommendations.

## Objective  

The goal was to enhance user experiences in music discovery by:  
- Addressing limitations in existing music recommendation systems (e.g., limited user input).  
- Promoting visibility for underrepresented music genres and artists.  
- Exploring innovative intersections of AI, machine learning, and user interaction.

  ```bash
  pip install uv
  ```  

### Installation  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ameensalim1/song-recommendation-system.git
   cd song-recommendation-system
   ```  

2. **Set up the python virtual environment**:  
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```  

3. **Install Python dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

4. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:  
   ```bash
   cd nextjsfrontend
   ```  

5. **Install Node.js dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```  

6. **Start the frontend server**:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```  

7. **Start the Flask backend**:  
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 app.py
   ```
